## What Do FurAgent Do? ðŸš—
FurAgent is a simple Elixir & Phoenix app that integrates with [FreeAgent](https://www.freeagent.com) and makes it easy to create multi-line invoices for services that span multiple days.  

The current FreeAgent user interface requires line items to be added individually, which gets a little painful when you're providing a daily service over multiple weeks (for example, Pet Sitting).

## Can I See FurAgent In Action?
Sure, you can check out FurAgent running in a sandbox environment:
